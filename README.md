# 📄 CertiNode

**CertiNode** is a decentralized academic document verification platform built with **React** and the **Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)**. It enables users to upload, verify, and mint documents as NFTs — ensuring authenticity and traceability in a secure and tamper-proof way.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **AI-based document verification**  
- 🔗 **ICP-powered decentralized storage**  
- 🧾 **NFT minting of academic credentials**  
- 🖼️ **Face verification via image matching**  
- 📤 **Seamless document upload and status tracking**  
- 🔒 **Secure and transparent system**

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend**: Python Flask (AI model server)  
- **Blockchain**: Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)  
- **AI/ML**: TensorFlow (ResNet model for image verification)

## 📦 Installation

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/certinode.git
cd certinode
```

### 2. Install dependencies

#### For frontend (React):

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

#### For backend (Flask):

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set up environment

Create a `.env` file in the root of the frontend with:

```env
ACADEMIC_CERTIFICATE_CANISTER_ID=your-canister-id
CANISTER_HOST=http://localhost:4943
```

---

## ▶️ Running the App

### Start the Flask backend:

```bash
cd backend
python app.py
```

### Start the React frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Upload Document**  
   Users upload an academic document and a facial image.

2. **AI Verification**  
   The image is verified using a ResNet-based deep learning model.

3. **Blockchain Storage**  
   Once verified, the document is stored on ICP as an NFT.

4. **NFT Minting**  
   A unique token is created as proof of document authenticity.
