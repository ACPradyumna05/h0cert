## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Upload Document**  
   Users upload an academic document and a facial image.

2. **AI Verification**  
   The image is verified using a ResNet-based deep learning model.

3. **Blockchain Storage**  
   Once verified, the document is stored on ICP as an NFT.

4. **NFT Minting**  
   A unique token is created as proof of document authenticity.
